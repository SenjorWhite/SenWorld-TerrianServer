# SenWorld-TerrianServer

This project is because that I was considering to implement a side project for my interview and put it on my resume before.

I spend a few days to find what I want to do and have to do; now I prefer to use this chance to finish the dream since I was a kid - To build a digital world on the cloud and can be controlled by myself. That won't be necessary a vast world but can contain some species that control by simple logic even AI.  Moreover, a human user can log in to manage their character.

Bluntly speaking, it will just be a tiny OLG server but can show some of my analysis, design and implementation skills of the back-end, even more.

So, I have started my side project, until I found a job here, even further.

Requirements:
1. A digital world in the cloud.
2. There are many environment creatures those controlled by simple logic even AI on the server.
3. Real world user can make a character and log in to the same world and interact with the environment objects, as well as the creatures.

Priorities:
	1. > 2. > 3.

Analyse (First Step):
	A digital world in the cloud.
	1. It should contain basic terrain => A terrain server.
		(1) Implements terrain unit.
		(2) (to be continued.)
	2. A terrain server should provide essential APIs for client access.
	3. Time flow.
